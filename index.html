        I'm from Ashburn, Virginia, and I love to play chess and go disc
        golfing. My passion for social good first began while I was interning at
        Accessible Community during high school. During my internship, I was
        shocked to learn about how so much of the internet is inaccessible to
        people with various disabilities. After working to increase
        accessibility, I found this experience very fulfilling and I'm eager to
        use my skills to help others.
